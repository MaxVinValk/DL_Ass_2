'''

    folder: The folder containing the images. Note that the other functions usually take the folder that
            contains the folder which has the images

    featureFile: The CSV file which lists which features are present in which images

    imageSize: The size of the image that we accept. A 2D tuple

    enc: The loaded encoder
